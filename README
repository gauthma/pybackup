Small script to ease backup to an encrypted drive. It mounts/decrypts the drive, backs up what has to be backed up, and unmounts/encrypts the drive. The files or folders to be backed up are read from a config file named backup.json, which must reside in the same place has the python script. 

The backup process has three steps:
 - create a tarball with the files/folders in dirs/directories and save it the settings/backup_dir_name in the encrypted drive
 - create a tarball with the files/folders in dirs/root_directories, and idem.
 - rsync the contents of the folders in dirs/rsync_directories to equally named folders in settings/backup_dir_name

INSTALL
Just copy the script and config file to any place of your choosing, customize the latter to suit your needs, and you're done.

ISSUES
 - Works with python 3.
 - Ctrl-C interrupts are not handled, and this may cause the terminal to go beserk (issuing a "reset" should fix it, though).
 - If only doing a backup, and sudo credentials have expired, the prompt for the passwords get garbled up in the midst of other ouput. To be fixed when time allows (because that's an use case I use rarely...)
